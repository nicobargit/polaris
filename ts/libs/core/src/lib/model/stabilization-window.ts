 * StabilizationWindow allows configuring the period of time that an elasticity strategy controller will

 * avoid unnecessary scaling.
 *
 * For example, suppose that ScaleUpSeconds = 180 and a horizontal elasticity strategy scales out at time `t` due to an SLO violation.
 * At time `t + 20 seconds` the SLO's evaluation still results in a violation, but the elasticity strategy does not scale again, because
 * the stabilization window for scaling up/out has not yet passed. If the SLO evaluation at `t + 200 seconds` still results in a violation,
 * the controller will scale again.
